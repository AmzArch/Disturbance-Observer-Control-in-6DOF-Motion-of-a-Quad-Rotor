# Disturbance-Observer-Control-in-6DOF-Motion-of-a-Quad-Rotor

As part of my Masters of Science in Robotics and Autonomous Systems degree, I completed the System Control and Optimization course at Arizona State University. For the group project, we modeled and simulated a Non-Linear 6 DOF Disturbance Observer that effectively rejected and reduced external disturbances/forces encountered by quadrotors in autonomous navigation. Check out our project to learn more about the disturbance observer and its applications.
